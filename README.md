Files of simulation for the article https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.24.477561 
- simulationPropre.m makes the figure 2 of the article
- simulationPropre_GrowthActivator.m the figure 4 of the article

These files makes the same simulation thant figure 2 and 4 but with a correlation of 0.43 between growth rate and lag time. 
We do not see any difference compare to the results of the previous code
- rand_LogN_Norm_Correl.m
- simulationPropre_Correl.m
- simulationPropre_GrowthActivator_Correl.m
